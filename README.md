# UNO-AI-GAME

The primary objective of this project is to create a sophisticated Uno AI capable of strategic decision-making, adaptive gameplay, and seamless integration into gaming scenarios.

<h3>Key Points:</h3>

<h4>Move Identification Excellence:</h4>
The project places a strong emphasis on the Uno AI's ability to identify optimal moves with precision.
Through meticulous design and strategic implementation, the AI has become proficient in recognizing and executing optimal plays seamlessly.

<h4>Strategic Gameplay Refinement:</h4>
The focus extends beyond move identification to strategic gameplay, ensuring the AI evolves its approach through continuous learning.
Training episodes in a carefully crafted environment lay the foundation for adaptive decision-making, allowing the AI to refine its strategy iteratively.

<h4>Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:</h4>
Thorough performance assessments and parameter adjustments play a crucial role in enhancing the AI's proficiency.
Metrics such as correct move percentages and win rates guide the refinement process, aligning the Uno AI with strategic goals.

<h4>Reinforcement Learning Empowerment:</h4>
Reinforcement learning techniques, particularly Q-learning, have been incorporated to empower the AI in optimizing decision-making.
This ensures that users are provided with an intelligent and challenging Uno opponent, enriching the gaming experience.

<h4>Technology Stack:</h4>
The project leverages a carefully chosen technology stack featuring Python and TensorFlow for machine learning components.
